        "Brendan Kim\\n\\n\\n\\nI had the pleasure of working with Minyoung at RBC for over a year. He consistently demonstrated expertise in software development and strong work ethics. Whenever I assigned him new tasks, he didn\\u2019t hesitate but made great effort to achieve the goals and was willing to go above and beyond to ensure the quality of his work. In addition, he is very passionate about new technology and learning, which helped our team become agile and stay ahead of cutting-edge tech.\\n\\nAlthough I had to leave the team for a new assignment, I am confident that Minyoung would be an excellent asset to your team and make valuable contributions in no time.",
        "Jude Calvillo\\n\\n\\n\\nThis may end up sounding repetitive, but only because it\\'s true: Minyoung is an absolute pleasure to work with. He\\'s extremely fluent in Salesforce MC development, while being a kind and steady sage of the platform/tech altogether. Moreover, his work ethic is unmatched. He\\'s seemingly always willing to go the extra mile to deliver on time and with smiles all around. I hope to work with him again in the future and would happily recommend him to the largest, most complex of organizations/applications."
